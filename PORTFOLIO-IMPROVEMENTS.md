# Portfolio Page Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Banner Section ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Portfolio page was showing two banner sections - one from the automatic banner template and one from the custom portfolio hero
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified `template-parts/banner-section.php` to exclude pages with custom hero sections
  - Added portfolio page template (`page-portfolio.php`) to the exclusion list
  - Also excluded other page templates that have their own hero sections:
    - `page-services.php`
    - `page-about.php`
    - `page-testimonials.php`
    - `page-team.php`
    - `page-pricing.php`
    - `page-home.php`
    - `page-careers.php`

### 2. Missing Images ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Portfolio items were referencing non-existent image files
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `images/portfolio/` directory
  - Replaced broken image references with CSS-based placeholder designs
  - Each portfolio item now has a unique gradient background with relevant icons
  - Placeholders are branded and visually appealing

- **Solution**:
