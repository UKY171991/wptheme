## 🔧 MENU SYSTEM FIXES - Multiple Submenu Labels Issue RESOLVED

### 📋 **Problem Identified**
Your WordPress menu was experiencing conflicts due to **DUPLICATE CSS CLASSES** being applied to submenu elements:
- The Walker class was adding both `sub-menu` AND `submenu` classes
- This created conflicting CSS rules and JavaScript targeting
- Multiple label submenus were not displaying correctly due to these conflicts

### ✅ **Fixes Applied**

#### 1. **Walker Class Cleanup** (`inc/class-blueprint-walker-nav-menu.php`)
- **BEFORE**: `<ul class="sub-menu submenu">`
- **AFTER**: `<ul class="sub-menu">` (WordPress standard)
- **Impact**: Eliminates duplicate class conflicts

#### 2. **JavaScript Standardization** (`js/menu-system.js`)
- **BEFORE**: Targeting both `.sub-menu, .submenu` classes
- **AFTER**: Targeting only `.sub-menu` class consistently
- **Enhanced**: Better depth detection and positioning logic
- **Improved**: Mobile touch handling for multi-level menus

#### 3. **CSS Standardization** (`css/menu.css`)
- **BEFORE**: Duplicate rules for both `.sub-menu` and `.submenu`
- **AFTER**: Single, clean `.sub-menu` ruleset
- **Added**: Enhanced z-index stacking for unlimited nesting levels
- **Improved**: Better positioning for 3rd, 4th, 5th+ level submenus

#### 4. **Multi-Level Support Enhancement**
- **Unlimited Depth**: Now supports 3, 4, 5+ levels of navigation
- **Better Positioning**: Off-screen detection and repositioning
- **Visual Indicators**: Proper arrows for different menu depths
- **Mobile Optimization**: Progressive indentation for nested levels

### 🎯 **Specific Issues Resolved**

1. **Multiple Label Submenus**: No more duplicate or conflicting menu labels
2. **Services Sub-submenu**: 3rd level navigation now displays properly
3. **Hover Conflicts**: Clean hover states without interference
4. **Mobile Touch**: Better mobile submenu expansion
5. **Z-Index Problems**: Proper layering for nested dropdowns
