3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Try running `debugMultilevelMenu()` in browser console

### If Submenus Don't Work
1. Check CSS loading order in functions.php
2. Verify z-index values in final-menu-fixes.css
3. Check for JavaScript conflicts with other plugins
4. Verify the custom Walker class is being used

### If Layout Issues Occur
1. Check responsive breakpoints in CSS
2. Verify CSS specificity for overrides
3. Check for conflicting styles from plugins
4. Test in multiple browsers and devices

## Best Practices for Future Development

3. **JavaScript Conflicts**: Use namespaced functions to avoid conflicts
4. **Accessibility**: Always include ARIA attributes and keyboard support
5. **Performance**: Minimize DOM manipulations and optimize animations
