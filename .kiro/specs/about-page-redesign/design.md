# Design Document

## Overview

The redesigned about page will completely overhaul every existing section while fixing structural issues, duplicate content, and broken HTML. The current page suffers from inconsistent messaging, fragmented story sections, conflicting statistics, and poor visual hierarchy. The new design will systematically improve each section: Universal Banner, Our Story, Core Values, Why Choose Us, Meet Our Team, Success Metrics, and Call-to-Action sections. Additionally, new sections will be added including Interactive Timeline, Service Process Overview, Enhanced Social Proof, and Trust Indicators. The result will be a cohesive, conversion-focused experience that builds trust progressively and guides users toward action.

3. **Redesigned Company Story** - Transform fragmented story into cohesive narrative with visual timeline
4. **Enhanced Core Values** - Improve existing values with proof points and real examples
